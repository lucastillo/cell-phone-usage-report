# cell-phone-usage-report
###Instructions
- Please download the code, open the code with an IDE.
- Execute the Main.java class
- The system will ask you for the year to execute the report
- The system will choose the first printer to send the document

###Solution
Regarding the solution I choose during the reading process I'm not parsing 
the complete date that I get from the CellPhoneUsage.csv, instead I just 
take the month and the year and then I filter it.

###Notes
If the file doesn't get printed please review the "resources" folder in this
project you will find a PDF of the report.
